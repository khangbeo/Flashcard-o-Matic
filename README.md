# Flashcard-o-Matic 

## Basic Info
I made a flashcard web app for the Thinkful front-end capstone project. The app allows users to create and edit their own deck of flashcards and study with the flashcards. Users can add more cards to the deck and edit the cards.

The project was intended to be used as part of a study program using flashcards.

## Responsibilities
I was responsible for designing the layout of the app and implementing all functionalities. 

## Tech Stacks
The app was built with React, React Router, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. 

## Discoveries
While making this app, I learned useful ways to use conditional rendering and setting up Routes using React Router to display multiple pages in a single page application. 

## Goals
Future goals for the project:
- deploying a server for the app
- adding a way to track correct and wrong answers
- implement a layout to show multiple cards on the same screen
- adding animation for flipping flashcards
- rework card flipping functionalities
- refactor and clean up code
- refactor styling to move away from a generic design
