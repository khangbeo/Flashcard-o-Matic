# Flashcard-o-Matic 

## Basic Info
I made a flashcard web app for the Thinkful front-end capstone project. The app allows users to create and edit their own deck of flashcards and study with the flashcards. Users can add more cards to the deck and edit the cards.

The project was intended to be used as part of a study program using flashcards.

## Responsibilities
I was responsible for designing the layout of the app and implementing all functionalities. 

## Tech Stacks
The app was built with React, React Router, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. 

## Discoveries
Initially, I struggled with defining the layout of the project. To get over this hurdle, I sketched out what I thought the layout should look like and built each components one by one. The hardest part to design were the form components and their routes. I built individual components for the forms so I had a lot of repeated codes for AddCard/EditCard and AddDeck/EditDeck. I also had some difficulties with using the ternary operator to render the respective form components. Eventually, I figured I could chain ternary operators to show what I wanted in the forms. With that discovery, I was able to reduce the amount of code and components that I needed to design. The other components were easy to design as they were individual pieces and didn't need to show anything else. 

## Goals
Future goals for the project:
- deploying a server for the app
- adding a way to track correct and wrong answers
- implement a layout to show multiple cards on the same screen
- adding animation for flipping flashcards
- rework card flipping functionalities
- refactor and clean up code
- refactor styling to move away from a generic design
